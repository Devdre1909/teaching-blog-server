# Simple Blog API

A minimal blog project created with Node Express and SQLite3 as database engine.

The project is beginner friendly with less code, and comment to help, it also used [SQLite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3) so not much setup of database will be required.

To get started, clone the repo, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devdre1909/teaching-blog-server
```

Move into the directory created by git **teaching-blog-server** then run
